I have a dream 
that one day every server shall be exploited, 
every computer and mobile device shall be made owned, 
the rough vulnerabilities will be made plain, 
and the crooked qbits will be made straight,
and the glory of the Cyber Lord shall be revealed, 
and all flesh shall see it together. 

This is our hope.
