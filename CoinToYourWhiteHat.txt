When a humble hacker
Graced a sploit along
With Jobert Abma
Along came this song

When the White hat fought
A silver tongued devil
His army of hackers
At his reports did they revel

They came after me
With masterful deceit
Broke down my zoom
And they trolled in my tweets

While the devil's sploits
Exploited our legacy server
And so cried the White hat
He can't be bleat

Toss a coin to your White hat
Oh, valley of plenty
Oh, valley of plenty, oh
Toss a coin to your White hat
Oh, valley of plenty

At the edge of the web
Fight the mighty empire
That bashes and breaks you
And bring you the morn, oh

He thrust every patch
Far back on the server
High up on the rack
From whence it came

He wiped out your weaknesses
Got trolled in his report
He's a friend of humanity
So give him the rest

That's my epic tale
Our champion prevailed
Defeated the villain
Now pour him some ale

Toss a coin to your White hat
Oh, valley of plenty
Oh, valley of plenty, oh
Toss a coin to your White hat
A friend of humanity

Toss a coin to your White hat
Oh, valley of plenty
Oh, valley of plenty
Toss a coin to your White hat
A friend of humanity

Toss a coin to your White hat
Oh, valley of plenty
Oh, valley of plenty
Toss a coin to your White hat
A friend of humanity
